"I had a dataset called HouseNew.csv that my professor gave me and told me to calculate it with three algorithms: KNN, Regression, and NB. I placed the calculations in one main file and, to increase calculation and execution speed, I created three other files so that whenever each algorithm is requested, it goes to that file and calculates immediately. You can put all four files together and enjoy using these three algorithms for calculations."
